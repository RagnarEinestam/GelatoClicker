    <string name="about_tv_about_me">This is a novel clicker game i made for a school assignment. I\'m currently finishing my last term before graduating \'Computer Science and Application development\' at Malmoe University.   \n\nThis was a fun little app to make, most of the time i spent on it went on finding assets and deciding on a theme for the app. I currently got some plans on future improvements i can make but for now this is version 1. \n\nEnjoy! :)</string>
